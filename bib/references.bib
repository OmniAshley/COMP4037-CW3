  abstract = {The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to financial investment is a research area that
  has attracted extensive research attention since the 1990s, when there was an accelerated technological
  development and popularization of the personal computer. Since then, countless approaches have been
  proposed to deal with the problem of price prediction in the stock market. This paper presents a systematic
  review of the literature on Artificial Intelligence applied to investments in the stock market based on a
  sample of 2326 papers from the Scopus website between 1995 and 2019. These papers were divided into
  four categories: portfolio optimization, stock market prediction using AI, financial sentiment analysis, and
  combinations involving two or more approaches. For each category, the initial introductory research to its
  state-of-the-art applications are described. In addition, an overview of the review leads to the conclusion that
  this research area is gaining continuous attention and the literature is becoming increasingly specific and
  thorough.},

  abstract = {Stock prediction has been a popular research
  topic and researchers have done a lot of work in this field.
  Due to its stochastic nature, predicting the future stock
  market remains a very difficult problem. This paper studies the application of attention-based LSTM deep neural
  network in future stock market movement prediction. We
  also build stock aggregate dataset and individual dataset
  including stock history data, financial tweets sentiment and
  technical indicators in the US stock market. The experiment studies the time sensitivity of finance tweet sentiment
  and methods of collective sentiment calculation. This paper
  also experiments on conventional LSTM and attentionbased LSTM for performance comparison. We find the
  finance tweets that are posted from market closure to
  market open in the next day has more predictive power on
  next day stock movement. The weighted sentiment on max
  follower on StockTwits also outperforms other methods. In
  our experiment, the result on our individual stock dataset
  shows a similar pattern like normal distribution.},

  abstract = {Price prediction tools play a significant role in small investors’ behavior. As such, this
  study aims to propose a method to more effectively predict stock prices in North America. Chiefly,
  the study addresses crucial questions related to the relevance of news and tweets in stock-price
  prediction and highlights the potential value of considering such parameters in algorithmic trading
  strategies—particularly during times of market panic. To this end, we develop innovative multilayer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to investigate the
  influence of Twitter count (TC), and news count (NC) variables on stock-price prediction under both
  normal and market-panic conditions. To capture the impact of these variables, we integrate technical
  variables with TC and NC and evaluate the prediction accuracy across different model types. We
  use Bloomberg Twitter count and news publication count variables in North American stock-price
  prediction and integrate them into MLP and LSTM neural networks to evaluate their impact during
  the market pandemic. The results showcase improved prediction accuracy, promising significant
  benefits for traders and investors. This strategic integration reflects a nuanced understanding of the
  market sentiment derived from public opinion on platforms like Twitter.},

  artificial neural network studies, support vector machine studies, studies using
  genetic algorithms combined with other techniques, and studies using hybrid or

  identify common findings, unique findings, limitations, and areas that need further

Arrival of computing, followed by Machine Learning has upgraded the speed of research as well as opened new avenues. As part of this research study, we aimed to predict the future stock movement of shares using the

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to review the methods that are used to construct
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithmic trading systems.
  Design/Methodology/Approach: A review approach of the existing knowledge was used.
  Findings: We find that there are various methodologies that are used by researchers and
  practitioners when they contract algorithmic trading systems. Some of the systems combine
  data from the financial markets alone and some methods combine financial data with social
  media data. The ability of computerized algorithms to integrate a large set of data and react
  almost immediately according to it, does not come without risks of accelerating downtrends
  in times of panic in the financial market and therefore those systems must be institutionally
  monitored by the regulating authorities.
  Practice Implication: This study enables readers to understand the major methodologies that
  are used to predict trends of financial assets prices. The research identifies and explains the
  complexity of methods that helps traders to improve their trading results.
  Originality Value: No past study has summarized the major methodologies that are used to
  construct and optimize trading results.},

  most important papers published in recent years that use the most advanced techniques to forecast

  trade the complex financial markets. All systems use deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML)
  protocols to explore nonobvious correlations and phenomena that influence the probability of trading
  success. Their predictions are based on linear or nonlinear models often combined with social media

  abstract = {Financial markets, such as the stock exchange, are known to be extremely volatile and sensitive to news published in the media. Using sentiment
  analysis, as opposed to using time series alone, should provide a better indication

  up or down movement of stock returns. The approach makes use of several different deep learning models, from vanilla models that rely on market indicators
  only, to recurrent networks that incorporate news sentiment as well. Surprisingly,
  the results suggest that the added benefit of sentiment analysis is diminute, and
  a more significant improvement can be obtained by using sophisticated models
